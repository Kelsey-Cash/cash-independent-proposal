Independent Project Proposal 

<p> 
  Project Name:  
Videography by Kelsey Website – (Name Subject to Change)

Overview (scope of work):  
My proposal is a new concept. I will be starting from scratch. I would like to create a business website for my future videography business. I might add photography to this as well. This would serve as a portfolio and connection place for prospective clients. This is an important project because it will show the client who I am and my overall style, while also raising awareness of my creative skills. I will be creating HTML webpages, Home, About, Videography, Photography, Contact Me. I would like to use Brackets to complete these because I have never used Bootstrap before. 

Goals:
Through this project, my goal will be to convey my style and personality to prospective clients, bring awareness and attention to my ability and talents, while also having effective design and structure that is also esthetically pleasing to users, practical and UX friendly.
